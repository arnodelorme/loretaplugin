# LORETA PLUGING

A plugin to export data from EEGLAB to the LORETA KEY software

This plugin is about exporting data from EEGLAB and using the LORETA viewer on Windows. There is also a new functionality in Dipfit 3.0 EEGLAB plugin to perform eLoreta from within EEGLAB.

The video below contains a rudimentary documentation on how to use the LORETA plugin to export ICA component topographies to LORETA. Note that it does not go into details of the LORETA model or how to import custom electrode positions. Click on the image below to be redirected to the Youtube video.
